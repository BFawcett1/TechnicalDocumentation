            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language
            resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression
            syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
            JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based
            on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based
            object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
            inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
            special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
            methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to
            implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header class="main-header">Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform
            to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be
            digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the
            characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences
            as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
            <header class="main-header">Declaring Variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
            With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <code class="code-block">var x = 42.</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
            By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <code class="code-block">x = 42.</code>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
            With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <code class="code-block">let y = 13.</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
            <header class="main-header">Data Types</header>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
            <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                    <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL,
                    or any other variant.</li>
                    <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                    <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                    <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                    <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>and Object</li>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Function_Declarations">
            <header class="main-header">Function Declarations</header>
            <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword,
            followed by:</p>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
            <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
            <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
            <code class="code-block">function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
            <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the
            argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by
            the function.</p>
            <code class="code-block">return number * number;</code>
            <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if
            the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
